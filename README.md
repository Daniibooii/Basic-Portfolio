# Basic-Portfolio

# Project Description
This was an early, and not particularly well-executed, attempt to create a personal portfolio website.<br>
The site includes three pages: the first or index page, a portfolio page to highlight my work, and a self-explanatory contact page.<br>

This was useful practice for my later work on a Bootstrap-utilizing portfolio, which is still in development.<br>

# How to Use
Just open up index.html with your browser of choice!<br>
